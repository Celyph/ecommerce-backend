# E-Commerce Backend 


## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a backend framework for an e-commerce website to run on.
- I built this project to further understand how to use back-end technologies in a more useful way.
- This code is effective in starting and maintaining a server.
- Composing this backend project, I learned how to build more of a backend framework than I had before.
